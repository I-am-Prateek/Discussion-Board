# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This Project is all about creating a chat Romm Web Application using React, BootStrap and Vanilla CSS& Js oin the frontend side whereas this will be 
backed by Java SpringBoot on the backend where all the logics of the Application will be maintained. This is a Full Stack Project Where All the data 
will be stored in the Databasse.

# This Project gave me the idea of creating a full stack application with React and Java. As this is my first Full Stack Application, I have learned so
much in this project about React Components, 
- how to implement BootStrap/Tailwind
- How to link the frontend and backend effectively
- perform CRUD operation
- Responsiveness of the Application

## Tech Stack Used:
- React, BootStrap, Vanilla CSS & JS
- Java SpringBoot
- MySQl, XAMPP

I will surely follow this principle to create more projects in the near future.
